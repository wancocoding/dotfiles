### after install python

```
==> python@3.9
Python has been installed as
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python3.9/site-packages

See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
```

### after install node@14

```
==> node@14
node@14 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have node@14 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/node@14/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find node@14 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/node@14/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/node@14/include"
```
